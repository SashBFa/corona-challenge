        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000" class="whatIs__p">Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis.</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="2000" class="whatIs__p">As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus.
